"""
Phase 2a: Rule-based generator for ipa_actual_ga (narrow IPA with GA allophonic
flap-t/d, glottal stop, syllabic n/l).

MECE rule set (GA, citation-form single words; no cross-word sandhi):

  R1. VtV / VdV flap
      /t/ or /d/, preceded by a vowel (optionally r), followed by an
      UNSTRESSED vowel  ->  /ɾ/
      e.g. party /ˈpɑrti/ -> /ˈpɑrɾi/ ; body /ˈbɑdi/ -> /ˈbɑɾi/

  R2. Syllabic /l/ (t/d + schwa + l at a following-unstressed environment)
      /t/ + ə + l  ->  /ɾ/ + l̩        (schwa deleted, t flaps)
      /d/ + ə + l  ->  /d/ + l̩        (schwa deleted, d stays; d+l cluster
                                        does not canonically flap because the
                                        following segment is not a vowel)
      e.g. bottle /ˈbɑtəl/ -> /ˈbɑɾl̩/ ; middle /ˈmɪdəl/ -> /ˈmɪdl̩/

  R3. Syllabic /n/ with glottal stop (t) / plain (d)
      /t/ + ə + n  ->  /ʔ/ + n̩        (schwa deleted, t glottalizes)
      /d/ + ə + n  ->  /d/ + n̩        (schwa deleted, d stays)
      e.g. button /ˈbʌtən/ -> /ˈbʌʔn̩/ ; garden /ˈɡɑrdən/ -> /ˈɡɑrdn̩/

  R4. VntV / VndV (nasal+stop flap) -- EXCLUDED from auto-generation.
      Speaker variation is high (winter: [ˈwɪɾɚ] vs [ˈwɪntɚ]); flagged for
      manual/Opus review, not auto-applied.

  R5. /t/ or /d/ followed by a STRESSED vowel, or preceded by a consonant
      other than /r/, or at a word boundary before a pause -> no change
      (excluded from candidates entirely).

No LLM is used in this script. Every word below is produced by pure regex /
tokenizer logic over the existing phonemic `ipa` field.
